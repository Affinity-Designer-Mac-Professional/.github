## What is Affinity Designer?

Affinity Designer for Mac is a **professional vector graphics editor** developed by Serif. It provides a seamless and powerful design experience for creating illustrations, icons, branding materials, user interfaces, and print projects with absolute precision. Its robust toolset and performance make it a leading alternative to Adobe Illustrator on macOS.

The application features a unified workspace that combines advanced vector and raster tools, allowing designers to switch between personas (Designer, Pixel, and Export) effortlessly. This integration streamlines workflows, from drawing sharp vectors to adding texture and effects.

**Affinity Designer Mac** delivers incredible speed and stability, leveraging macOS technologies like Metal for GPU acceleration. It supports millions of percent zoom, real-time performance, and continuous auto-saving, ensuring a smooth and efficient creative process. Whether you're a professional graphic artist or a hobbyist, Affinity Designer offers the tools and flexibility needed to bring your ideas to life.

Optimized for **MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac Studio**, it runs natively on both Intel and Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3) processors. Fully compatible with **macOS Ventura, Sonoma, and earlier versions**, it ensures a responsive experience even with complex documents.
